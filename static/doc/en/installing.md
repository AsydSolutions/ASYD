Installing ASYD
===============
<br/>

**1. Install dependencies**

Most dependencies are installed via gems, but it first needs ruby, git, make and some standard
libraries for it to work

On Debian-based systems (as root):

    apt-get update && apt-get install -y ruby1.9.1-full ruby1.9.1-dev git libxslt-dev libxml2-dev libsqlite3-dev make

On RedHat-based systems:

    yum install -y ruby ruby-devel git libxslt-devel libxml2-devel libsqlite3-devel make

**2. Install ASYD from git**

Install bundler and clone the git repository

    gem install bundler
    git clone https://github.com/AsydSolutions/asyd.git

Or get the development branch (recommended while it is in heavy development stage,
might be unestable though)

    git clone https://github.com/AsydSolutions/asyd.git -b devel

Install ASYD and all the dependencies

    cd asyd
    bundle install

**3. Start ASYD**

    passenger start

Access your newly ASYD installation from the machine itself, or using the IP and
the port 3000
([http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/))

**4. Setup**

Once you open ASYD for the first time, it will prompt you for an user, email, password
and ssh keys, which can be provided by the user or automatically generated by ASYD.

When all data has been provided, ASYD will set up the new installation allowing you to use it
