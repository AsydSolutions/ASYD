<pre>Eveything works via webinterface, except for the deploy declaration.

Check "Servers" section for adding servers,
you only need the server IP and the -root- password for adding it to ASYD.

You can also install packages alone on the "Deploys" menu,
separated by spaces (i.e. htop nano vim).

-- Deploys --

For creating deploys, browse on your ASYD server to the "data/deploys/" directory,
the file structure is the following:
 * A directory named as the name of the deploy (i.e. data/deploys/LAMP/)
 * A "def" file with the definition of the packages to be installed,
   configurations and commands to be executed (i.e. data/deploys/LAMP/def)
 * A "configs" directory with the configuration files and folders to be uploaded
   (i.e. data/deploys/LAMP/configs/apache/apache.conf)

The def file structure is as follows:
 install [if <condition>]: package_a package_b package_c
 config file [if <condition>]: file.conf, /destination/route
 config dir [if <condition>]: confdir, /destination/route
 exec [host][if <condition>]: command
 monitor [if <condition>]: service
 deploy [if <condition>]: another_deploy

Deploy example:
 - data/deploys/LAMP/def:
   install: apache mysql-server php5
   config dir: apache2, /etc/apache2
   config file: php.ini, /www/php.ini
   exec: service apache2 restart
 - data/deploys/LAPM/configs/:
   * apache2/
   * php.ini

-- Configuration files --

You can use the following global variables on any configuration file, they will
get automatically replaced.
 <%%ASYD%> - ASYD IP
 <%%HOSTNAME%> - Target host name
 <%%IP%> - Target host IP
 <%%DIST%> - Target host linux distribution
 <%%DIST_VER%> - Target host distribution version
 <%%ARCH%> - Target host architecture
 <%%MONITOR:service%> - Monitors the service 'service'
 <%%VAR:varname%> - You can add your custom variables
 You can define custom variables on both hosts and hostgroups, if a host has the
 same variable name as his hostgroup, it will use the host one, so you can override
 variables on selected hosts inside a group

All this variables can be used on any configuration file inside the "configs"
directory on a deploy, inside the "data/monitors/" directory, or as conditionals
for "def" files on a deploy.

-- Conditionals --

Valid conditions are ==, !=, >= and <=
Example condition:
  install if <%%DIST%> == debian and <%%DIST_VER%> == 6 or <%%DIST%> == centos and <%%DIST_ver%> >= 5: package
</pre>
