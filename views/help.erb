<pre>Eveything works via webinterface, except for the deploy delcaration.

Check "Servers" section for adding servers,
you only need the server IP and the -root- password for adding it to ASYD.

You can also install packages alone on the "Deploys" menu,
separated by spaces (i.e. htop nano vim).

-- Deploys --

For creating deploys, browse on your ASYD server to the "data/deploys/" directory,
the file structure is the following:
 * A directory named as the name of the deploy (i.e. data/deploys/LAMP/)
 * A "def" file with the definition of the packages to be installed,
   configurations and commands to be executed (.e. data/deploys/LAMP/def)
 * A "configs" directory with the configuration files and folders to be uploaded
   (i.e. data/deploys/LAMP/configs/apache/apache.conf)

The def file structure is as follows:
 install: package_a package_b package_c
 config file: file.conf, /destination/route
 config dir: confdir, /destination/route
 exec: command -params

Deploy example:
 - data/deploys/LAMP/def:
   install: apache mysql-server php5
   config dir: apache2, /etc/apache2
   config file: php.ini, /www/php.ini
   exec: service apache2 restart
 - data/deploys/LAPM/configs/:
   * apache2/
   * php.ini

</pre>
